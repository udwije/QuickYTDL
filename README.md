## 📢 New in v1.2.0 (Audio Branch)

- **MP3 Download Support**  
  Download playlists or individual videos as MP3 files.  

- **Sample-Rate Selector**  
  When “mp3” is chosen as the global format, choose between 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz.  

- **Smarter Button States**  
  - **URL Validation**  
    The **Fetch** button is only enabled when the URL field contains a non-empty, valid URL.  
  - **Download Enablement**  
    The **Download** button becomes enabled as soon as at least one item is selected.  
  - **Cancel Always Available**  
    The **Cancel** button remains clickable at all times—so you can abort fetching or downloading in mid-stream.

- **Cleaned-up Logging**  
  Duplicate log entries in the **Complete Log** tab have been eliminated—every status message now appears only once.

- **Improved UI Reliability**  
  Under-the-hood refactors ensure no more “zombie” threads or dangling signal connections.

  Set a default format for the entire batch, or pick a different format for each row.

  Centered % text in each row, plus overall speed & ETA in the status bar.  
- ⚙️ **Auto-Shutdown Option**  
  Have your machine shut down when all downloads finish.  
- 🎞️ **Bundled FFmpeg** (via `imageio-ffmpeg`)—no separate install required.  
- 🖼️ **Custom App & Taskbar Icon** on Windows.
